# Carabiner Distributor XOL

The distributor for the XOL toolboard. 
Be warned that this does not use the official carabiner pinout, and as such can cause damage to your electronics, unless used with the XOL toolboard.

## Features

- Input via 16pin horizontal or vertical microfit
- Testpads for easy thermistor troubleshooting
- Easy to read labeling of the connectors

## Connectors & Amperage

_Note: All amperage-values have been designed to work in an enclosed printer with up to 65Â° chamber temperature & have  some safety margins. While you could use higher ampere in an open-frame printer, it's highly discouraged. <br/>
When multiple connectors are supported **bold** marks the recommended connector._

Be aware that the distributor pcb has 2 options for connectors regarding the thermistor and heater.

## Using the Testpads

When using both the hotend and chamber thermistor, it is important to ensure that you don't accidentially have the Ground swapped with the Thermistor-Pin.
To validate your thermistors are wired up correctly, it's recommended to use a multimeter and the Testpads on the Distributor.
Connect the Distributor to the mainboard of the printer.
When everything is wired up correctly, the resistance between the two Testpads should be close to 0 Ohms. 
If it does not measure 0 Ohms, please check your wiring and ensure that both ThTest as well as ThGnd are wired to the ThermistorGnd on the mainboard of your printer.
