- Output for partcooling fans
- Soldered seperate voltage selection for hotend fan and partcooling fan
   - Uses either the hotend voltage or one alternative voltage


## Connectors & Amperage

_Note: All amperage-values have been designed to work in an enclosed printer with up to 65Â° chamber temperature & have  some safety margins. While you could use higher ampere in an open-frame printer, it's highly discouraged. <br/>
When multiple connectors are supported **bold** marks the recommended connector._

|   | Supported Connectors | Maximum Ampere |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| Hotend  | 2-pin JST XH <br/> Microfit 430450227 <br/> **Microfit 436500227** (compatible with e3d heater) | ~2 Ampere (50W heater on 24V) <br/> 4.2 Ampere (100W heater on 24V) <br/>4.2 Ampere (100W heater on 24V)
